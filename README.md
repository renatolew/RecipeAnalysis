# RecipeAnalysis

This project aims to analyse the data of over 125.000 recipes to obtain the most common ingredients and cooking skills used. This data is to be further presented in a visualization model using Power BI, you can find a PNG file with the final report here.

The data utilized by the python script was compressed to make it possible to push it to Github, so you need to extract the files from the .rar files before executing the python script. 

This data was not scraped by me, you can find its source at https://eightportions.com/datasets/Recipes/#fn:1. There is a python script that automatically downloads the dataset in this project, if you want to get the untouched dataset.

In order to execute this project you will need Python installed in your computer. In order to edit or complement the code you will need a text editor or IDE of your choice. I recommend Jetbrains Pycharm. You can find links to install these features below:
